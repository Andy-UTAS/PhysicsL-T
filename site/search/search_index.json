What is the PL&T hub? \u00b6 From where does it come? \u00b6 The creation of this site came about from my first teaching experience in semester two, 2021, whereby I was thrust into a teaching role but with little detail about what exactly the role involved, in that there was no documentation outlining expectations around both teaching and content, no timeline of activities, no list of methods or resources, rather everything runs on institutional knowledge. As someone from outside the institution, and a desire to streamline procedures and disseminate information, this site is an ever-expanding resource of things that I have learned, a repository to detail how things are currently done, and provide resources to aid with navigation of the system. What is here? \u00b6 In the first instance, the bulk of materials are items that are pertinent to teaching a course when one has never previously taught at UTAS , but beyond this, I want to have a space for documenting systems and tools that have proven worthwhile in my teaching adventures. How do I use what is here? \u00b6 Information on course structure, what are expectations, and how to be navigate specific problems should be consumed in a piecemeal fashion, that is to say as needed; however, there is a fair bit of content relating to developing teaching materials and practises, which are probably best used through example. To expand, it is probably best to see a demonstration a tool or method, either through in-person discussion or linked examples, and then treat the content here as a \"how-to\" guide. There is also a resource library, which can be scanned for ideas and inspiration. Salt advised A large chunk of (Mongolian) rock salt.

I would encourage anyone to provide ideas, feedback, and corrections.

It will also serve as a \"one-stop-shop\" for queries that demonstrators (or their students) may have. Background \u00b6 Demonstrators form a cornerstone of the experimental program at UTAS . Traditionally, academic members of staff have taught lab classes, with and without the assistance of post-graduate students providing additional teaching support. Labs are supposed to be a more laid back environment as compared to tutorials or lectures, and feedback from past and current students is that this is achieved when teaching staff are not academics. The ideal scenario for labs is therefore to have highly-trained, competent, and engaging postgraduate students to educate undergraduate students in the ways of experimental physics. A description of the experimental program as of 2022 is listed below. First-year physics - Part I labs \u00b6 The first-year physics program is comprised of two physics subjects (KYA101 and KYA102 - details can be found here ) with one subject running per semester and course subscription results in approximately 60 students. Labs are run as single experiments - that is all students complete the same experiment in a given session - with each experiment roughly synchronised with the course curriculum. Labs are run with two demonstrators, usually an experienced demonstrator being coupled with a new or less experienced demonstrator. The lab (Part I, room 236) has a capacity of 18 students and normally only three lab classes are required as distance students make up roughly 15% of students. Explicit details on the labs can be found either on the Teams channel or on POLUS The first-year labs are coordinated by Danijela , but I think this is actually a responsibility that Danijela has taken upon herself. Ultimate responsibility for the labs falls to the unit coordinator. Second-year physics - Part II labs \u00b6 The second-year physics program is comprised of two physics subjects (KYA211 and KYA212 - details can be found here ) with one subject running per semester and course subscription results in approximately 25 students. Labs are run as individual experiments - that is all students complete different experiments in a given session - with each experiment roughly corresponding to content which appears in the course that semester. Consequently, two distinct sets of experiments are offered in semester one and two. Labs classes are run with two demonstrators, usually an experienced demonstrator being coupled with a new or less experienced demonstrator. The lab (Part II, room 233) has a capacity of 18 students and normally two lab classes are run. Explicit details on the labs can be found either on the Teams channel or on POLUS The second-year labs are coordinated by Andy , but again, this is a responsibility that I have taken upon myself. Ultimate responsibility for the labs falls to the unit coordinator. Second-year physics - Part II labs \u00b6 The third-year physics program is comprised of many physics subjects (details can be found here ) with multiple subjects running per semester, some of which are elective subjects. Labs are tied to multiple subjects (KYA320 and KYA321) and are taught by individual academics, with most staff having responsibility for 1 or 2 labs. Course subscription results in approximately 10 students, so labs are managed in a very ad hoc manner, but the labs are also much more involved affairs with individual experiments running for a number of weeks and containing content which needn't appear in any course. Explicit details on the labs can be found either on the Teams channel or on POLUS The labs are officially coordinated by Andy . Responsibilities and expectations \u00b6 In teaching a lab class, demonstrators have a number of responsibilities, which - in a vague \"chronological\" order - include: * Taking class attendance : a check-in registration system is in place to allow students to mark their attendance, but this attendance should be verified as engagement is an assessable component of labs * Supervise students : when teaching, a demonstrator has a duty of care over the students and any fellow demonstrators. This means having a working knowledge of procedures and how to access information in the event of an accident or emergency * Teach students experimental physics : it is expected that you will have a sound knowledge of the experiments and associated physics, which includes troubleshooting the apparatus - we want to teach problem solving, and there is no better way to demonstrate the utility of the skill than with effective deployment of said skill. * Have fun : enjoying yourself and conveying the wonders of the natural world is delightful, and genuine excitement for science, and knowledge more generally is often contagious, and that is something we really do want to spread (obviously one should do this in a COVID-safe manner) Administration \u00b6 Second year attendance q","title":"Demonstrating"},{"location":"teaching/demonstrating/#demonstrating","text":"This page is designed to be a resource for current and future demonstrators, with a core aim to inform demonstrators what is expected of them and provide resources for learning best-practice methods for teaching experimental physics.

The .yaml format (commonly .yml ) is a human readable language commonly used for configuration files, and stands for \"YAML Ain't Markup Language\". Basically, one loads in the desired libraries and extensions for the site, in addition to specifying the site structure by pointing to markdown files which actually contain the content for each page.

In the simples form, one uses markdown of the form: ![image name](link to image) for example, the code ![malamute](malamute.jpg) places the image malamute.jpg : It is unlikely that one will place images without some configuration; the image above is left justified and rather small. Below, methods for simple image manipulation are outlined. .yaml configuration Most image manipulation is performed using the attribute lists extension which should be enabled in the mkdocs.yaml : markdown_extensions : - attr_list Sizing \u00b6 Sizing is most easily achieved (with consistent outcomes) using the width attribute. Using this, one can specify the width of the image (in pixels) or as a percentage of the page width. No width designation will place the image at full size or the page width, whichever is smaller. To alter the width attribute, one should use place the width parameter inside curly brackets {} , for example: ![Image title](image location){width=<width>} Shown below are the same image placed with a range of width parameters: width = 300 The markdown used to produce the above image is ![malamute](malamute.jpg){width=\"300\"} width = 50% The markdown used to produce the above image is ![malamute](malamute.jpg){width=50%} width unspecified The markdown used to produce the above image is ![Image title](malamute.jpg) Alignment \u00b6 If you have spent any time with HTML , you will appreciate that alignment is non-trivial. So whilst the align attribute is now depreciated, it is still supported by all browsers, and that is unlikely to change. It also provides a relatively easy way to perform alignment. As with the width attribute, one should place the alignment flag inside curly brackets {} , for example: ![Image title](image location){align=<alignment flag>} Shown below are the same image placed with different alignment flags: Left Text written below the markdown to place the image will be wrapped on the right of the image.

For example, the markdown ![malamute](malamute.jpg){width=\"600\" : .center} gives the placement: Captions \u00b6 In order to have a caption for an image, it is necessary to use HTML directly: < figure markdown > ![Image title](image location) < figcaption > Image caption </ figcaption > </ figure > Object attributes can be specified, but unlike image placement with markdown, the image will be placed centrally by default.

I subscribe to a model whereby people are facilitated to engage with content during lectures, which hinges on having easily accessed, high-quality resources available to all students. My goal in to have in essence an interactive textbook, which is open source, and students are both encouraged and required to perform calculations and computations within the notes. The burden of production is high, but the end result is appreciated by students, and is more generally a useful resource to others at the university and further afield. Where to start? \u00b6 There are many options for hosting web content. My journey for making web content started with using commercial CMS systems including Squarespace for a personal site , Joomla , and WordPress , but these are not really ideal for educational content. I did build a site from the ground up in HTML ( POLUS , the undergraduate lab website), but this was not efficient, robust or configurable. I did consider a wiki format , which definitely could be adapted for an educational setting, but the best solution that I came across when researching this was MkDocs , a static site generator which is designed around producing technical documentation, and maps very naturally to educational content. Without shilling too much for MkDocs, it produces aesthetically pleasing sites, which are highly configurable and critically can have maths and computational content embedded in myriad ways. Moreover, given it a documentation suite, unsurprisingly, the documentation is top notch! MkDocs or bust Despite the title of this section being \"Web-based material\", it would probably read better as \"MkDocs for web-based material\", with all content here on out only discussing MkDocs. How does one set up a website? \u00b6 Depending on one's web development experience, the concept of creating, hosting, deploying and maintaining a website might be daunting, but the point of this page it to demonstrate that it is not difficult, indeed, if one has a rudimentary command over either Latex and/or markdown , one is 95% of the way there. Specifics and peculiarities \u00b6 MkDocs \u00e0 la Andy \u00b6 There are many ways to configure MkDocs and one should explore these possibilities, especially as they are ever expanding, but ultimately I settled on using the Material for MkDocs theme. Worth noting in advance are the two distinct ways in which content can be prepared: 1. Preparing markdown pages and serving created content (figures etc.) 2.

I subscribe to a model whereby people are facilitated to engage with content during lectures, which hinges on having easily accessed, high-quality resources available to all students. My goal in to have in essence an interactive textbook, which is open source, and students are both encouraged and required to perform calculations and computations within the notes. The burden of production is high, but the end result is appreciated by students, and is more generally a useful resource to others at the university and further afield.","title":"Web-based material"},{"location":"teaching/website/#where-to-start","text":"There are many options for hosting web content. My journey for making web content started with using commercial CMS systems including Squarespace for a personal site , Joomla , and WordPress , but these are not really ideal for educational content. I did build a site from the ground up in HTML ( POLUS , the undergraduate lab website), but this was not efficient, robust or configurable. I did consider a wiki format , which definitely could be adapted for an educational setting, but the best solution that I came across when researching this was MkDocs , a static site generator which is designed around producing technical documentation, and maps very naturally to educational content. Without shilling too much for MkDocs, it produces aesthetically pleasing sites, which are highly configurable and critically can have maths and computational content embedded in myriad ways. Moreover, given it a documentation suite, unsurprisingly, the documentation is top notch!
