### How do I get a class list?

There are two ways to get a list of students enrolled in a given class: using the LMS of using MyAcademic. The former is a little easier and faster, but is subject to inaccuracy as students can be added or removed from this list with relative ease, meaning it is not an "official" class list, but it generally does the job: given most material is distributed through the LMS, if somebody is taking the class and does not appear in this list, that will likely spell trouble. The official class list can be obtained through MyAcademic, and is the only place to obtain a classlist with students photos.

#### Using MyLO

A list of students can be found on [MyLO](../teaching/lms), although depending on that which you want to do, it may not be a slick process. To view a list of students, one can select `Classlist` from within a given unit as shown in the image below:

Should one wish to export a list of students, one should take a different approach, instead selecting `Grades`

and then clicking `Export`

This will open the _Export Grades_ window, and by setting the following options (with the desired perturbations)

| Field | Value |
| :----: | :----: |
| **Export Grade Items For** | `All users` |
| **Key Field** | `Org Defined ID` |
| **Sort By** | `Last Name, First Name, Org Defined ID, Username` |
| **Grade Values** | _None_ |
| **User Details** | `Last Name` and `First Name` |

combined with an empty selection under **Choose grades to export**, one can export the list of students with student ID to either a `.csv` or `.xlsx` file.
