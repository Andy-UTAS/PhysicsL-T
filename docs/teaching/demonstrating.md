# Demonstrating

This page is designed to be a resource for current and future demonstrators, with a core aim to inform demonstrators what is expected of them and provide resources for learning best-practice methods for teaching experimental physics. It will also serve as a "one-stop-shop" for queries that demonstrators (or their students) may have.

## Background

Demonstrators form a cornerstone of the experimental program at UTAS. Traditionally, academic members of staff have taught lab classes, with and without the assistance of post-graduate students providing additional teaching support. Labs are supposed to be a more laid back environment as compared to tutorials or lectures, and feedback from past and current students is that this is achieved when teaching staff are *not* academics. The ideal scenario for labs is therefore to have highly-trained, competent, and engaging postgraduate students to educate undergraduate students in the ways of experimental physics.

A description of the experimental program as of 2022 is listed below.

### First-year physics - Part I labs

The first-year physics program is comprised of two physics subjects (KYA101 and KYA102 - details can be found [here](../#undergraduate-course-structure)) with one subject running per semester and course subscription results in approximately 60 students. Labs are run as single experiments - that is all students complete the same experiment in a given session - with each experiment roughly synchronised with the course curriculum. Labs are run with two demonstrators, usually an experienced demonstrator being coupled with a new or less experienced demonstrator. The lab (Part I, room 236) has a capacity of 18 students and normally only three lab classes are required as distance students make up roughly 15% of students. Explicit details on the labs can be found either on the [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a372d42c3a072471bbac171fd8473862f%40thread.tacv2/KYA101_2022?groupId=96b4d5d1-b7b5-48a2-966b-fb22b3925a19&tenantId=15eb5d55-1991-46bc-8da7-ab25234dee08) or on [POLUS](http://utasphys.cloud.edu.au/POLUS/partI/)

The first-year labs are coordinated by [Danijela](mailto:danijela.ivkovic@utas.edu.au), but I think this is actually a responsibility that Danijela has taken upon herself. Ultimate responsibility for the labs falls to the unit coordinator.

### Second-year physics - Part II labs

The second-year physics program is comprised of two physics subjects (KYA211 and KYA212 - details can be found [here](../#undergraduate-course-structure)) with one subject running per semester and course subscription results in approximately 25 students. Labs are run as individual experiments - that is all students complete different experiments in a given session - with each experiment roughly corresponding to content which appears in the course that semester. Consequently, two distinct sets of experiments are offered in semester one and two. Labs classes are run with two demonstrators, usually an experienced demonstrator being coupled with a new or less experienced demonstrator. The lab (Part II, room 233) has a capacity of 18 students and normally two lab classes are run. Explicit details on the labs can be found either on the [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a123d6325346b4d75ae5e8377b8db5db7%40thread.tacv2/Second-year%2520labs?groupId=96b4d5d1-b7b5-48a2-966b-fb22b3925a19&tenantId=15eb5d55-1991-46bc-8da7-ab25234dee08) or on [POLUS](http://utasphys.cloud.edu.au/POLUS/partII/)

The second-year labs are coordinated by [Andy](mailto:physics.labs@utas.edu.au), but again, this is a responsibility that I have taken upon myself. Ultimate responsibility for the labs falls to the unit coordinator.

### Second-year physics - Part II labs

The third-year physics program is comprised of many physics subjects (details can be found [here](../#undergraduate-course-structure)) with multiple subjects running per semester, some of which are elective subjects. Labs are tied to multiple subjects (KYA320 and KYA321) and are taught by individual academics, with most staff having responsibility for 1 or 2 labs. Course subscription results in approximately 10 students, so labs are managed in a very ad hoc manner, but the labs are also much more involved affairs with individual experiments running for a number of weeks and containing content which needn't appear in any course. Explicit details on the labs can be found either on the [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a689dd47fd6b54462a62b300027b7a978%40thread.tacv2/Third-year%2520labs?groupId=96b4d5d1-b7b5-48a2-966b-fb22b3925a19&tenantId=15eb5d55-1991-46bc-8da7-ab25234dee08) or on [POLUS](http://utasphys.cloud.edu.au/POLUS/partIII/)

The labs are officially coordinated by [Andy](mailto:physics.labs@utas.edu.au).

## Responsibilities and expectations

In teaching a lab class, demonstrators have a number of responsibilities, which - in a vague "chronological" order - include:
	* **Taking class attendance**: a check-in registration system is in place to allow students to mark their attendance, but this attendance should be verified as engagement is an assessable component of labs
	* **Supervise students**: when teaching, a demonstrator has a duty of care over the students and any fellow demonstrators. This means having a working knowledge of procedures and how to access information in the event of an accident or emergency
	* **Teach students experimental physics**: it is expected that you will have a sound knowledge of the experiments and associated physics, which includes troubleshooting the apparatus - we want to teach problem solving, and there is no better way to demonstrate the utility of the skill than with effective deployment of said skill.
  * **Have fun**: enjoying yourself and conveying the wonders of the natural world is delightful, and genuine excitement for science, and knowledge more generally is often contagious, and that is something we really do want to spread (obviously one should do this in a COVID-safe manner)
