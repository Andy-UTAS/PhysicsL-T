## Timeline

~~I am sure that a timetable exists~~ I actually wrote the previous sentence before realising that given my experiences, there is not reason to suspect this. One can monitor the university's [key dates page](https://www.utas.edu.au/key-dates); however, as this is for general consumption, there is little detail for the academic looking for teaching deadlines. Instead, one can see the timeline for my first teaching semester, which was instantiated during the first half of the semester, so this is by no means complete, but the week outlines might prove useful
