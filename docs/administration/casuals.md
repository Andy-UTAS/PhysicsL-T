# Casual staff

Casual staff, especially postgraduate students form a crucial part in delivering the teaching program. It is important that workload expectations, including realistic allocations of time and resources, are deployed in order to ensure high-quality work is delivered in a timely fashion, without placing undue stress on any particular party.

## Roles and responsibilities

Casual staff can occupy any number of roles within the discipline, school, and university more broadly. In physics, the most common roles a casual staff member will occupy are that of a [lab demonstrator](#demonstator), [tutor](#tutor), or [marker](#marker).

### Demonstrator
[Details on rates of pay are listed below](#Demonstrating).

### Marker
[Details on rates of pay are listed below](#Marking).

### Tutor
[Details on rates of pay are listed below](#Tutoring).

## Remuneration and levels

The rates of pay are laid out in the [staff agreement](https://www.nteu.org.au/tas/agreements) (see _SCHEDULE 4 - SALARY RATES - TEACHING-FOCUSED EMPLOYEES_), although the most recent agreement has expired and the new one is being negotiated.

### Demonstrating
Casual lab demonstrating falls under the loading `S Other required academic activities`, which attracts a rate of $49.40/hour. In the event that the marker holds a PhD, the loading will be `T Standard marking`. Note that this rate of pay does not include any preparation time, meeting attendance and familiarisation will be accrued in addition to any teaching time.

### Marking
Casual marking falls under the loading `Q Standard marking`, which attracts a rate of $49.40/hour. In the event that the marker holds a PhD, the loading will be `R Standard marking`.

### Tutoring
Casual tutoring falls under the loading `E Tutorial` for the first tutorial in a 7-day period, with loading `F Repeat Tutorial` applying in the 7-day period of the original tutorial. In the former case, it is expected that the tutor will deliver content for one hour, with two hours of preparation time, and in the latter case, it is expected that the tutor will deliver content for one hour, with one hour of preparation time. These loadings attract rates of $148.19/hour and $98.80 respectively. In the event that the tutor holds a PhD, the loading will be `G Tutorial` and `H Repeat Tutorial`.
