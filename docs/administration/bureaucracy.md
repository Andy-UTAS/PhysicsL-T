# Bureaucracy

Despite being a site ostensibly focused on learning and teaching, one can never stray too far from administrative/bureaucratic tasks. Sometimes it is worth resisting the addition of tasks to an already full plate, but in other circumstances, it is worthwhile to embrace tools and methodologies that can make life a little easier. It is just a shame these tend to be in the minority :crying_cat_face:

## Shared mailboxes

In addition to one's personal email UTAS outlook account, it is possible to create and use a shared mailbox, be it for a project, class, or any other grouping; notable examples are [SNS Admin](mailto:sns.admin@utas.edu.au) and [Physics Labs](mailto:physics.labs@utas.edu.au). The content here describes how to create and configure a shared mailbox.

### Creation

As with most requests, this is done through the ServiceNow and can be accessed from the main dashboard through _Forms_ $\rightarrow$ _Technology_ $\rightarrow$ _Email and Calendars_ $\rightarrow$ _New Shared Mailbox_. One requires a display name for the mailbox

    Where you are required to "list the names of employees to be included in this shared mailbox", ensure to add yourself to this list if you want to have access as this is not allocated by default

### Usage

Once the request for a new mailbox has been process, or you have been granted access to an existing mailbox, you will be able to access the mailbox through outlook. Being deeply rooted in the Microsoft ecosystem, I suspect it is not worth trying to secure access from anything other than outlook, but individual preference will ultimately determine that. To set up access in outlook is easy enough, and there is [information a plenty](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=add+shared+mailbox+outlook&t=ffab&ia=web) on how to do this. The guides below are taken from the [Microsoft guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-outlook-d94a8e9e-21f1-4240-808b-de9c9c088afd) and worked well as of December 2021.

#### Access

1. Open Outlook
2. Choose the _File_ tab in the ribbon
3. Choose _Account Settings_, then select _Account Settings_ from the menu
4. Select the _Email_ tab
5. Make sure the correct account is highlighted, then choose _Change_
6. Choose _More Settings_ $\rightarrow$ _Advanced_ $\rightarrow$ _Add_

2. Choose New Email.
3. If you don't see the From field at the top of your message, choose Options > From.
4. Click From in the message, and change to the shared email address. If you don't see your shared email address, choose Other email address and then type in the shared email address.

#### Calendar access

Once you have been added to the shared mailbox, ouy should have access to the shared calendar which should appear in the calendar tab under _My Calendars_.
